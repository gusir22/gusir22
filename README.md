# Hello there! I'm Gustavo Rivero

> I'm a 28-year-old web developer with a passion for the internet, coding, and building useful tools. My journey into tech began during my college years at FIU, where some introductory programming classes inspired me to pursue a second bachelor's degree focused on web development.<br><br>
I specialize in building web apps using Python, the Django framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills. One of my proudest projects is a full-featured website I built for my dad's construction business using Django. <br><br>
Outside of code, I'm a proud cat dad to Luna and Bonita, happily married to my wife Albany, and a big fan of hockey, Minecraft, superhero movies, and comedies. I also love rocking out to rock and alternative music. Originally from Venezuela, I speak both Spanish and English.
