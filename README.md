# ![spotlight-left](assets/icons/spotlight-left.png) Hello there! I'm Gustavo Rivero ![spotlight-right](assets/icons/spotlight-right.png)

> I'm a 28-year-old web developer with a passion for the internet, coding, and building useful tools. My journey into tech began during my college years at FIU, where some introductory programming classes inspired me to pursue a second bachelor's degree focused on web development.<br><br>
I specialize in building web apps using Python, the Django framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills. One of my proudest projects is a full-featured website I built for my [dad's construction business][cis] using Django. <br><br>
Outside of code, I'm a proud cat dad to Luna![black cat](assets/icons/blackcat.png) and Bonita![white cat](assets/icons/whitecat.png), happily married to my wife Albany![ring](assets/icons/ring.png), and a big fan of hockey![hockey](assets/icons/hockey.png), videogames![videogames](assets/icons/videogame.png), superhero movies![superhero](assets/icons/hero.png), and comedies![comedy](assets/icons/comedy.png). I also love rocking out to rock and alternative music![rocknroll](assets/icons/rock.png). Originally from Venezuela![Venezuelan Flag](assets/icons/vnz.png), I speak both Spanish and English.<br><br>
