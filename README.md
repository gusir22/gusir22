# Hello there! I'm Gustavo Rivero &#128227;

> I'm a 28-year-old web developer with a passion for the internet, coding, and building useful tools. My journey into tech began during my college years at FIU, where some introductory programming classes inspired me to pursue a second bachelor's degree focused on web development.<br><br>
I specialize in building web apps using Python, the Django framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills. One of my proudest projects is a full-featured website I built for my [dad's construction business][cis] using Django. <br><br>
Outside of code, I'm a proud cat dad to Luna![black cat](assets/icons/blackcat.png) and Bonita![white cat](assets/icons/whitecat.png), happily married to my wife Albany&#128141;, and a big fan of hockey&#127954;, videogames&#128377;&#65039;, superhero movies&#129464;&#127995;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039;, and comedies&#129315;. I also love rocking out to rock and alternative music&#127928;. Originally from Venezuela&#127483;&#127466;, I speak both Spanish and English.<br><br>
